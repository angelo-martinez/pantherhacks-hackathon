**Abstract:**

The Covid-19 pandemic shook our communities as Covid-19 patients began to swarm hospitals at an alarming rate. While most were given the option to practice self-isolation in an effort to avoid infection, healthcare workers were caught in the middle of a crossfire between patients in sudden need of ventilators and that of an unexpected increase in demand for personal protective equipment, also known as PPE. As the patients kept coming and the cases doubled per day, there seemed to be a shadow of gloom as healthcare workers began to get sick themselves, compromising their patients, and their loved ones.

Luckily, a small group of heroes from the maker movement heeded the call to action and quickly mobilized together with universities and businesses to help hospitals keep up with demand. These makers took to forums to create, share, and 3D print the PPE and ventilators necessary to save lives. Each of them willing to volunteer their time, filament, and creativity as a community to fight Covid-19.

Inspired by the efforts of these healthcare heroes and master makers, we created printMD, a solution designed to effortlessly unite the healthcare community with the maker community. PrintMD’s quick to set up login page splits the users into two categories: Healthcare Hero and Master Maker, where they will fill out a quick registration page. Once verified each of these heroes and masters will be guided towards the corresponding user-friendly dashboard. Here the Healthcare Hero will be able to make a Request for our pre-approved 3D printable Medical Equipment, select the quantity, the delivery method, and the urgency of the request. After all settings are set, an estimated cost range, of up to $60, will be provided and the user will have the option to forward the request to a priority queue.

Once in the Queue, a Master Maker will be able to select up to one request at a time and provide an estimated time of completion and price based solely on the cost of the material used and the delivery method. When the Master Maker is ready to print, the file containing the 3D printable medical equipment will download and an update containing the new information will be sent to the Healthcare Hero, moving the previously In-Queue request into the Healthcare Hero’s In-Progress list, where the Healthcare Hero can Stop the print at any time in case of a reduced urgency or need.

When the print is stopped or completed, the Master Maker will have the option to send an update confirming the final price and delivery method. The Healthcare Hero will then have the option to accept the final price and delivery method or, in the case of an unexpected change in delivery preference, select postpone and then proceed to reach an agreement via direct messaging. Once an agreement is reached the Master Maker will update the final price and delivery method and submit it to Healthcare Hero for approval. Allowing for quick, effective creation and delivery of all necessary equipment to hospitals and patients.

It is through this productive collaboration between two very different communities that we will continue to see ourselves through current and future global health crises. PrintMD is the first layer solution of a multilayered problem. PrintMD, together we build up.
